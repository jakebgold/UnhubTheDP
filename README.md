## Directions to set up your own
Set up in AWS Lambda as a function. You'll need to add Tweepy, requests, and requests-oauthlib as folders in the root directory and fill in the keys with Twitter Developer credentials. In AWS, set the timeout to five minutes and add a trigger that has the bot run as often as you would like, as low as every six minutes. This runs every 30.
